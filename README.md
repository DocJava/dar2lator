# Dar2lator

A revamp of [last year's attempt](https://github.com/DocJava/Dartulator) to make a calculator clone web-app in Dart.

This version no longer uses angular and instead is written purely in dart.

There are bugs, I am working on them, feel free to create issues for them incase I do not know of them

Otherwise, thanks for checking out the project!
